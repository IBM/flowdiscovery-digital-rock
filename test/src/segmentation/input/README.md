# Disclaimer

All images in `test/src/segmentation/input/` were downloaded from 
[ImageProcessingPlace.com](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/root_files_V3/image_databases.htm).

The image bundle is described as 
> "Standard" test images (a set of images found frequently in the literature: Lena, peppers, 
> cameraman, lake, etc., all in uncompressed tif format and of the same 512 x 512 size)

but only the `512 x 512` images without an Alpha channel were used.
